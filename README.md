# pr3-uAlert
A system for unobtrusive alerts in Platform Racing 3.


## How To Use
To start, call `uAlert.initialize()` to start things. 
  If it fails to start, the player will be alerted the normal way, and the function will return false.
  Otherwise, it'll return true, and you'll be able to make alerts the better way!


To make an alert, call `uAlert.add(text,time,fadeTime)`

  `time` is the time in milliseconds that the alert exists
  
  `fadeTime` is the time in milliseconds that the alert spends fading out.
